# Face-mask-detection
 The Face Mask Detection project uses YOLOv8 to detect whether individuals are wearing masks in real-time via webcam. It identifies three classes: "with mask," "without mask," and "incorrectly worn mask." The system displays bounding boxes and labels on detected individuals, enhancing safety by monitoring mask compliance in public spaces.
